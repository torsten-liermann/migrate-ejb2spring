== Entity Beans (EJB 2.x)
Entity beans are a deprecated EJB model and have been replaced by JPA. A migration to Spring Boot always involves re-implementation as JPA entities and repositories. Automated migrations don't make sense for entity beans.
=== Differences in the model
Entity beans have container-managed persistence, home interfaces, and lifecycle methods such as `ejbLoad` and `ejbStore`. JPA entities, on the other hand, are simple POJOs with annotation mapping and are managed via `EntityManager` or Spring Data.
=== Migration strategy
* Analyze entity bean and associated home/remote interfaces
* Define JPA entity with `@Entity` and appropriate relations
* Create repositories or DAO classes
* Transfer business logic from bean classes to services
A targeted reimplementation is required for projects with EJB 2.x. The recipes can only help with changing package names or imports.
