== XA transactions
EJB containers support JTA and XA transactions via the Application Server. Spring Boot can also use XA, but requires a suitable transaction manager (e.g. Atomikos, Narayana, Bitronix). The migration must therefore examine whether distributed transactions are still required or whether an alternative integration strategy is possible.
=== JTA to EJB
By default, EJB uses JTA when multiple resources are involved. Transaction control is done via the container and `@TransactionAttribute`. The configuration often lies in the server and not in the application.
=== XA in Spring Boot
Spring Boot supports JTA via special launchers and an explicit `JtaTransactionManager`. The data sources must be configured to be XA-capable. Errors in the configuration lead to partial commits or inconsistent states.
=== Migration aspects
For the migration, it must be clarified whether XA remains technically necessary. Alternatives such as outbox patterns, sagas or idempotent processing are only relevant if distributed transactions are to be replaced. If XA is still required, the JTA Manager and XA DataSources must be explicitly configured and tested.
