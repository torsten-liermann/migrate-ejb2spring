== Edge cases
The recipes highlight points where additional technical decisions are required. These areas are collected in the migration report and fleshed out in the review.
Typical edge cases are:
* `@RunAs` and other security changes
* EJB timer with persistent semantics or calendar exceptions
* CDI qualifiers with attributes or complex type resolutions
* JCA connectors and proprietary resource adapters
* JNDI lookups for non-standard resources
* Remote interfaces with proprietary protocols
The decision regarding alternatives is made at the architectural level and documented in the project.
