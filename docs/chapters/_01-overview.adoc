== Overview of the migration
Migrating from EJB/Jakarta EE to Spring Boot is not just an annotation exercise. Many concepts can be mapped technically, but the semantics differ in key areas: life cycle, transactions, remoting, security context and asynchronous processing follow different rules. The recipes transform clearly depictable constructs and create review markers for areas requiring additional decision-making.
On this basis, the migration topics can be structured into direct illustrations and illustrations that require review. Direct images concern e.g. E.g. `@Stateless` to `@Service`, `@TransactionAttribute` to `@Transactional` or JSON‑B to Jackson‑annotations. Review requirements arise where additional configuration or architectural decisions are required, such as @MessageDriven, @Schedule, @Asynchronous, security annotations, CDI producers or JNDI lookups.
The recipes follow a simple maxim: transform only what is clear and make visible all implicit assumptions. Therefore, review entries arise in places where additional architectural decisions are required, such as `@Startup`, `@Lock`, `@RunAs`, CDI qualifiers or JCA connectors. This reduces the risk of silent functional changes and bundles open points in the migration report.
The following chapters explain each topic professionally and technically: what the EJB construct means, how it can be represented in Spring, which deviations are relevant and which alternatives make sense depending on the application context.
