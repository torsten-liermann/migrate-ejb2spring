== Recipe order
The order of the recipes influences the result of the migration. Some transformations change package names or annotations that are expected by subsequent recipes. Therefore, a fixed sequence is necessary to achieve consistent results.
Examples:
* Package and import changes must run before recipes that match specific types.
* CDI migrations should occur before JAX-RS transformations when class signatures are changed.
* Configuration recipes (e.g. `application.properties`) should be run after code transformations so that they can obtain complete information from the code.
The pipeline in `rewrite.yml` reflects these dependencies. Changes to the sequence should be validated with a full dry run to avoid unwanted side effects.
