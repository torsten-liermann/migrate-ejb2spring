== Tests
EJB applications are often tested using Arquillian or container-based integration tests. Spring Boot provides a different test model with `@SpringBootTest`, `@DataJpaTest` and other test slices. The migration should consciously differentiate between technical integration tests and isolated unit tests.
=== Container-based testing
Arquillian typically starts an application server and deploys the EJB application. In Spring Boot, the context is launched within the test and can be connected to external dependencies such as databases via test containers.
.Example: AFTER (Spring Boot)
[source, java]----
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.test.context.ActiveProfiles;

@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("test")
class BookingFlowTest {
}

=== Test container for infrastructure
Test containers can be used for databases or messaging. If development-time services are planned in the project, the build and start paths must be explicitly documented. This does not replace infrastructure configuration for productive environments.
=== Test stubs and configuration
EJB tests often use stubs via CDI producers or deployment descriptors. In Spring, test stubs are typically integrated via `@TestConfiguration`, `@MockBean` or via profiles. The decision depends on whether the stubs are only needed in the test context or also in integrated environments.
