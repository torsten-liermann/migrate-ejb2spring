== JCA (Java Connector Architecture)
JCA connectors are a container feature that standardizes resource adapters, connection management, and transactional integration. The migration includes evaluating existing connectors, their JNDI bindings and the integration paths in the target system.

=== Typical applications
If JCA is used in the system, the associated JNDI names, adapter configurations and transaction requirements must be collected before a target technology is determined.
=== Migration to Spring
In Spring Boot, integration is implemented via specific starters, adapter libraries or explicit client configurations. Where possible, transactional boundaries should be supported by the target system. If transactional integration is not available, the business logic must be secured with compensation steps or idempotence strategies.
=== Checkpoints for the project
Before migration, the existing JCA resources must be collected:
[cols="1.3"]
|===
| aspect | Test

| Adapter configuration
| Which resource adapters are defined in `standalone.xml` / `domain.xml`?

| JNDI-Bindungen
| Which `java:/` or `java:jboss/` bindings are used for adapters?

| Connection Factories
| Which `ConnectionFactory` types are injected (`@Resource`)?

| Transaktionsintegration
| Do adapters use XA transactions or local transactions?

| Adapter-Typ
| Outbound (Client to EIS) or Inbound (Message-Driven)?

=== Typical migration paths
[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
| JCA Adapter | Spring Alternative | Note

| JMS Adapter
| Spring JMS with `JmsTemplate` / `@JmsListener`
| Preferred migration path for messaging

| JDBC Adapter
| Spring `DataSource` with connection pool
| Standard approach for database access

| Mail Adapter
| Spring `JavaMailSender`
| See mail chapter

| Proprietary EIS adapters
| Spring Integration or direct client library
| Project-specific analysis required
