== Migration strategies
There is no universal path from EJB to Spring Boot. The appropriate strategy depends on the system size, operating environment, and rate of change. This chapter describes typical procedures and their effects.
=== Big Bang Migration
A complete conversion in one step can make sense if the application is stable, the domain is well understood and test coverage is available. The risk lies in a large fault space that is difficult to isolate.
=== Strangler approach
An incremental approach gradually replaces EJB components with Spring services. This requires clear interfaces, for example via REST or messaging. This approach reduces risk but requires a transitional architecture.
=== Module wise migration
For modular applications, migration can be done per module, e.g. B. first technical infrastructure, then technical services. This requires clear demarcations of data storage and defined interfaces.
A successful migration often combines several strategies. What is crucial is a robust testing strategy and clear governance for architectural decisions.
