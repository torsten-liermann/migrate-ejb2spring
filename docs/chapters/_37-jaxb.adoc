== JAXB
JAXB is widely used for XML bindings in Jakarta EE. Spring Boot still supports JAXB, but requires additional dependencies depending on the Java version because JAXB has been moved out of the JDK. Migration is typically minor but requires deliberate dependency checking.
=== JAXB in Spring Boot
If JAXB classes already exist, they can usually continue to be used unchanged. However, build configurations need to ensure that `jakarta.xml.bind` dependencies are in the classpath. Alternatively, Jackson XML can be used if the application already relies on Jackson.
The migration should check whether JAXB is used for external XML contracts and whether the serialization rules are allowed to change.
