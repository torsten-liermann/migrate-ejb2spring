== Jakarta EE reference applications
The migration recipes are validated against two reference applications. Both projects use Jakarta EE 10, implement different architectural decisions and cover different APIs. This allows migration risks to be identified early and recipes to be tailored specifically to typical enterprise patterns.
Cargo Tracker covers messaging, batch processing, WebSocket and multiple service layers. The application is suitable for checking the interaction of asynchronous processes, eventing and transactions. Petclinic Jakarta EE contains typical CRUD and UI flows and serves as a reference for classic web applications.
These references do not serve as an architectural blueprint, but as a validating test base. Findings from the migrations flow into recipe design, documentation and regression testing.

=== Coverage of relevant APIs
The combination of both applications covers the most important Jakarta EE building blocks for migration: EJB session beans, transactions, CDI scopes, JPA, JAX-RS, security, timer service, JMS and complementary APIs. In addition, special cases such as producer methods, qualifiers or deployment descriptor overrides can be understood.
