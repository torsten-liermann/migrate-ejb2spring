== Deployment descriptors
EJB applications can supplement or override annotations with `ejb-jar.xml`, `web.xml`, `persistence.xml`, and other descriptors. In Spring Boot, these configurations are usually replaced with Java configuration and `application.properties`. The migration must therefore take into account both annotations and descriptor overrides.
=== ejb-jar.xml
`ejb-jar.xml` can declaratively define transaction attributes, interceptors, security roles or JNDI names. When switching to Spring, this information must be explicitly included in annotations or configuration classes. The mapping follows the project decisions and the actual descriptor overrides.
Deployment descriptors may supplement or overwrite annotations. The migration must therefore check whether transaction, security or interceptor rules in `ejb-jar.xml` differ from the annotations. Without this examination, silent behavioral changes occur.
=== web.xml
`web.xml` controls filters, listeners, security constraints and servlet mappings. In Spring Boot, corresponding settings are mapped via Java configuration, security configuration and `application.properties`. Some settings, such as `session-timeout`, can be applied directly, others require a reevaluation of the web architecture.
=== persistence.xml
`persistence.xml` contains the JPA configuration and defines the persistence provider. In Spring Boot, this configuration is typically represented in `application.properties` and optional `@Configuration` classes. Differences between EclipseLink and Hibernate must be taken into account.
