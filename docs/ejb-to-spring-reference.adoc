[.lead]
Complete reference for migrating Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) 3.x and Jakarta EE constructs to Spring Boot. Each section shows BEFORE (EJB/Jakarta EE) and AFTER (Spring Boot) with concrete code examples.
[IMPORTANT]
====
Spring Boot does not provide an EJB container. This eliminates EJB-specific runtime services such as pooling, passivation/activation for stateful beans, container-managed remoting, @Lock semantics, MDB runtime and JCA resource adapter. The migration is therefore a change of programming model and not just an annotation swap.

== Migration categories
[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
| Kategorie | Charakteristik | Beispiele

| API‑nah (mechanisch)
| Spring uses the same or similar APIs. Migration is largely mechanical (namespace change, annotation mapping).
| JPA, Bean Validation, JSON-B, Servlet, JAX-RS → Spring MVC

| Container semantics (architecture)
| The EJB container provides runtime behavior that Spring does not replicate. Requires architectural decisions.
| Stateful Beans, Singleton-Locking, MDB, Timer, JCA, Remoting
|===

[NOTE]
====
This project uses constructor injection in all examples. Field injection is not used in the examples.
